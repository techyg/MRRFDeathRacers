# MRRF Death Racer FPV System

I've provided this information for purposes of adding an FPV to the MRRF Death Racer.  This is currently a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates as well as example video.

This system should have the capability to work with either Digital or Analog FPV goggles. I have listed a few potential choices, though I am designing the initial version for the DJI FPV digital system.
